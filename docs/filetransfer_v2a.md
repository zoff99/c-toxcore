## how do filetransfers in tox work

sender --->                                   | ---> receiver
-------------------------------------------------------------------
tox_file_send()                               |
  new_filesender()                            |   
    file_sendrequest()                        |
      write_cryptpacket_id()                  |
       network[PACKET_ID_FILE_SENDREQUEST] -> | -> network[PACKET_ID_FILE_SENDREQUEST]
                                              | <- network[-ACK-]
                                              |      [-OFFLINE-] --> EEE001 --> FT will break
                                              |        m_handle_packet() --> [break] --> EEE002 --> FT will break
                                              |          [OK] --> all good from here on
                                              |        


## toxcore changes for ftv2a

we need to tell the sender that the receiver has actually received
the "file send request" and has fully processed it.
